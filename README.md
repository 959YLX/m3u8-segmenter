Segmenter
=========

segmenter is an Apple HTTP Live Segmenter. It takes an MPEG-TS stream from a
tool like ffmpeg and breaks it up into multiple ts-segments suitable for HTTP
Live streaming from devices like iPhones. It also creates the M3U8 stream
descriptor which is required for this type of stream.

It was originally written by Chase Douglas and is now maintained by John
Ferlito.

Note on Patches/Pull Requests
-----------------------------

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
